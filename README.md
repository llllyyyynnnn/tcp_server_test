# C++ TCP Server test

A small project with basic TCP functionality where unlike UDP, it does the bare minimum to verify that the data is being acknowledged. 

Start the server before the client, as the client application will exit as soon as there's nothing being transmitted. 
The client is able to send a message until the server acknowledges it and decides to send a message back.
